## Old Business

**Club Picnic** Zach, KC3KHK, reported reserving the Merrit's Pond Campground for the BCARS picnic on August 17th with a plan to eat around noon.

**Legion Appreciation** was discussed - Zach volunteered to investigate with local vendor for producing a suitable display piece out of a classic amateur radio microphone.

**WPA SET Exercise** was discussed. There is a local net checkin component and a winlink element. KB3DFZ expects to receive more detailed information Friday.  BCARS will run a check-in net from 9:30AM to 12PM Noon on Saturday April 6th.

**Bloody Run Float Festival** will be held May 18th in Everett. Members are encouraged to come and help out with this event. BCARS usually supports this by spotting float participants and relaying their status from various points along the route towards the finish line.

**Workshop and VE Session is May 11th.**  BCARS will host their VE Session at the Legion on May 11th at 9:30 and the workshop to follow after around 11AM. For this workshop, the club will be learning about the systems in the BCARS Communications Van as well as giving it some much needed care.

## New Business

**Repeater Updates** KB3DFZ discussed the 146.790 repeater. One of the antennas has gone bad over the winter. Operation has been switched over to the auxillary antenna, restoring the repeaters coverage. The primary antenna will need to be repaired or replaced in the near future. However, a larger problem started occuring around the 27th of March with interference keying up the repeater randomly through the day. A signal with the propper tones is activating this repeater. In response, KB3DFZ has bumped the squelch from 600 to 800. This makes it harder for weaker signals to active the repeater, but still allows Southern operators (W3DRW, KK3F, and KC4RCR) to access it. 

Possible sources of the interference were discussed and we will continue to investigate. We may also try adjusting changing PL tone to see if the interference is tone specific.


With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at **2027** hours.


Respectfully Submitted,



John Hogenmiller, KB3DFZ  
BCARS Secretary
