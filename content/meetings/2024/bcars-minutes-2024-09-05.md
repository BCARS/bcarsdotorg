## Old Business

Lost Turkey Trail sent a donation to thank us for our support in the 2023 and 2024 events. BCARS appreciates this donation and Zach will send them a thank you.

BCARS still has several History of BCARS books available. KC3DNB will bring them to Winter Field Day.

VE Session will be held this Saturday, September 7th. This will be at the Bedford American Legion. The Element 4 Extra exams need to be printed and updated, BCARS will do that during the session. KB3DFZ reports that he will not be available for the workshop afterwards.

The Anniversary Picnic was discussed. Everyone enjoyed the food, especially the corn. We should pay extra attention to ensure cooking and serving utensils are available at future events.

## New Business

Winter Field Day will be at the Shawnee Lodge, same as in 2024. The dates will be Jan 25th and 26th, 2025.

December Holiday dinner was discussed. This will be December 5th, 6:30PM at Hoss's Steak and Seafood. Zach will reach out for RSVPs and numbers.

Fall Set exercise was discussed. Pending direction from WPA, several members were interested in having a repeat of visiting firehouses across the county to establish comms.

With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2017 hours.

Respectfully Submitted,  


John Hogenmiller, KB3DFZ
BCARS Secretary
