## Old Business

**Winter Field Day** was discussed. It will be held at Shawnee State Park Lodge. The event runs on Saturday the 27th at 2PM through the 28th at 2PM EST. The park office will open the lodge building for BCARS on January 27th by 9AM and we can return the keys when we leave. The lodge is setup to host medium sized groups overnight with heat and electricity.  We can plan to stage equipment on Friday evening, with  most of the setup to take place the day of. Zach, KC3KHK will need to know who is interested in participating and what supplies people can bring. 


## New Business


**Equipment Insurance was discussed**. Our current carrier has decided to stop offering equipment insurance as of February 10th.  This means that BCARS will have to search out new insurance providers, and build a current inventory list. BCARS officers will work on this present quotes by the February meeting.

**Van registration renewal is also due.**  Kip, N2XRE as the call sign trustee and current van custodian has offered to do the renewal and investigate if we can obtain an amateur radio plate of K3NQT for the van.


With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at **2035** hours.


Respectfully Submitted,
