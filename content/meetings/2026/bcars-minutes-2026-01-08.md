## Old Business

**Winter Field Day** was discussed. This takes place Jan 24th-25th. We have plans for 4 stations, but we only expect to operate 3 at a time, so we will operate as 3I.  Llloyd relayed that the new EC for Bedford County is Brittany McConnell. Lloyd has proposed an emcomm exercise to take place during field day for 1 hour to send traffic to the EOC.

**Special Event in October** Steve, KE3ZT discussed this event at the coffee pot.  Needs to be decided on a date and submitted to QST about 10 months out.  The club decidd on October 3rd and to operate on 40, 20, and 15 meter bands.




## New Business

**Ham Radio Vanity Plates** were discussed by Jay, K3SCM.  In attempting to get one renewed, they were told they were no longer available. In checking the DMV website, they not shown anymore on the website when you search. Since it doesn't show up in search, they believe it's not available.  We investigated during the meeting and found that the form MV-904 is still current and allows you to request Amateur Operator Registration plates.


With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2030 hours.

Respectfully Submitted,
