## Old Business

**Winter Field Day** was discussed. An Emcomm exercise was held between K3QNT and KE3ZT during field day, exchanging a number of simulated emergency messages.  With winter weather, operation at Shawnee was cancelled. Instead, K3IP and KB3DFZ operated Winter Field Day from the EOC as 1I. 

**Parks On The Air** K3IP discussed operating POTA from Shawnee Lodge if we can find a suitable date in the winter without a storm and the lodge is available. We will attempt a date in March.


## New Business

Activity - KE3ZT discussed the America 250WAS Award, a centennial contest. W1AW will be dispatching 5-6 stations that will roam the countryside as portable stations. If you work them in each state, you can qualify for a certificate from the ARRL. There are several levels to this award. 

K3QNT reports that the W3ZC-1 amateur radio license plate has been ordered for the BCARS Van. It is on the way.

K3QNT presented a billy from Ritchey Ritchey and Koontz for $60 to file the clubs yearly tax records.  Motioned to be paid by KE3ZT and seconded by W3DRW.

With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2006 hours.

Respectfully Submitted,
