## Old Business


**Winter Field Day 2025** was January 25th and 26th. The scores were discussed. There 162 contacts for 288 points, this was before any multipliers. 

**Summer Field Day** Is June 28-29th.  Officers are working with Harrisburg to secure the Blankley Picnic area location.  The process has changed and gotten more involved than in previous years.

## New Business

**VE session and Workshop**. KB3DFZ reports the next VE session is February 22nd, 9:30AM at the Bedford American Legion Post 113.

The **activity schedule** for the year has been updated and discussed. Of note, the WPA Spring Set is April 5th, and Bloody Run Float Festival is May 17th. We are still waiting to find out when the Lost Turkey Trail will be held. Additionally, the club anniversary picnic in August needs to be scheduled.

The treasurer related that only about 12 members have renewed so far for 2025. 

With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2015 hours.

Respectfully Submitted,  


John Hogenmiller, KB3DFZ
