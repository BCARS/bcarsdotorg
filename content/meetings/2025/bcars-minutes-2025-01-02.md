## Old Business

**Repeater Update**, KB3DFZ discussed the updates to the UPS batteries at Martin Hill and Kinton Knob. Batteries were replaced for the Eaton UPSes at Martin Hill and Kinton Knob. The Tripp Lite UPS at Martin Hill internal batteries are also having issues. We have attached external batteries, but need to run software to enable their use. 

**Winter Field Day 2025** is January 25th and 26th. Radios, food, and antennas were discussed. 


## New Business

**Summer Field Day 2025**.  After discussion, the club will attempt to have it this year at the Blankley Picnic area in Buchanan State Forest. This location has plenty of trees and shade, parking, and outhouses.  BCARS will need to bring their own generator power.

With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2015 hours.

Respectfully Submitted,
