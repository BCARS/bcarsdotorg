## Old Business

**Bloody RUn Float Fest** will be Saturday May 17th in Everett. Finish line is at the ball field behind Igloo. BCARS plans to gather at 7:30AM at Burger King in Bedford before heading to the field. Registration opens at 7AM, the race starts at 9AM. BCARS members need to assign positions and be in place by the time the race starts.

**Repeater Updates** KB3DFZ provided an update on the 146.790 GE Master II repeater. The PA (Power Amplifier) is no longer working. John and Kip put a temporary, unlinked repeater in place while they look into replacement or repair options.  It was discussed the cost of a new repeater with some suggestions of getting a brand new repeater under warranty. If so, the new repeater would go to Kinton Knob, replacing the 145.490 Tait mobile, and the existing 145.490 Tait could go down to Martin Hill. The repeater committee will continue investigating options.

**Field Day** The Blankley Park Picnic area is confirmed for 2025 Summer Field Day.


With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2015 hours.

Respectfully Submitted,  


John Hogenmiller, KB3DFZ  
BCARS Secretary
