## Old Business

**Repeater Update** John Hogenmiller, KB3DFZ report that the 145.490 was swapped out with a Hytera RD982. The new Hytera 1062 was attempted, but upon arrival at the site, we discovered that audio was not being passed out to the controller. Further investigation needed.

**Route 66 Special Event** KE3ZT discussed the Route 60 Special event that goes from Sept 4th through 14th, passing around the station list.

**VE Session and Workshop** is on September 6th. It is held the American Legion, starting at 9AM for VEs.

## New Business

**Van Driver List** Upon reviewing the insurance policy on the van, many names were listed that had not driven the van in years. K3QNT motioned to revise the list to a smaller set of active drivers. The new list will be WB3JEK, KE3ZT, K3IP, and KB3DFZ.  Seconded by KB3DFZ. Motion carried.  It should be noted that while the insurance wants a list of responsible parties, officers can still authorize any member to drive the van as needed.

**Summer Field Day** was discussed. Egolf Park and East Beach pavilliion were proposed as possible locations. Motioned by K3QNT, seconded by W3DRW. Motion carried. K3QNT will contact for both locations and report back at the October meeting.


With no further business, the meeting was adjourned at **2010** hours.

Respectfully Submitted,  


John Hogenmiller, KB3DFZ  
BCARS Secretary
