As BCARS programs a fair number of radios for members and friends, we have standardized on our frequency list that we load onto radios. This list does change over time, but we will attempt to keep all common lists on this page.

You can download the CSV file for programming. There are three variations.

- [Printable PDF of 2020 Master List](/files/BCARS-2020-Frequencies-bedfordrequencies-2020.pdf)
- [BCARS FREQUENCIES 2020 Master List](/files/BCARS-2020-Frequencies-bedfordrequencies-2020-BCARS-2020-Frequencies-bedfordrequencies-2020.csv). Includes 2M, 1.25M, and 70cm frequencies. Useful for reference or tri-band radios.
- [BCARS FREQUENCIES 2020 2m/440 List](/files/BCARS-2020-Frequencies-2m-440-BCARS-2020-Frequencies-bedfordrequencies-2020.csv). Same as above, but with 1.25m (220Mhz) frequencies removed. Useful for dual band 2m/440 radios.
- [BCARS FREQUENCIES 2020 2m/1.25 List](/files/BCARS-2020-Frequencies-2m-220.csv). Only 2M and 1.25M (220Mhz) frequencies. Useful for radios with 2M and 1.25M capabilities.

By far, the most common radios programmed by BCARS are Baofengs  Our programming application of choice is [CHIRP](http://chirp.danplanet.com/). CHIRP works with many radios, is free (open source), and can read in CSV files. Often “OEM” provided programming tools either cost money or require you to enter each frequency by hand.

If you are attempting to program a radio, many “cheap” cables come with a counterfeit “Profilic” chipset. If you are having any trouble with getting your programming cable to work, please see [miklor.com](http://www.miklor.com/COM/UV_Drivers.php) for help.
