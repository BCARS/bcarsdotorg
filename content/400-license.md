**FCC Amateur Radio Service Licensed VE Testing Program**

The Bedford County Amateur Radio Society (BCARS) regularly hosts a VE licensing exam, followed by an Amateur Radio Workshop/Technical Forum. This is an exceptional opportunity for those interested in earning an amateur radio license.

Testing includes the three Amateur Radio license classes, TECHNICIAN, GENERAL, and AMATEUR EXTRA. The event is open to anyone. BCARS is provides testing through the Laurel VEC, and there is NO CHARGE to take the exam. Absolutely free, and we won’t even ask for a donation. You are also welcome to attend our free workshop following the event. This is a good place to get radio recommendations, get a radio programmed, or learn more about the hobby and first steps.
